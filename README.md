# Managed Streaming Kafka Project

## Overview
This project demonstrates how to set up a data streaming pipeline using AWS Managed Streaming for Apache Kafka (MSK). The pipeline ingests a housing regression dataset, processes the data through Kafka topics, and outputs the results to an analytics service, enabling real-time data processing and insights.

## Key Components
- **AWS Managed Streaming for Apache Kafka (MSK)**: A fully managed service to build and run applications that use Apache Kafka for streaming data.
- **Amazon S3**: Used for storing raw and processed data.
- **Amazon Kinesis**: A service to collect, process, and analyze real-time streaming data.
- **Amazon DynamoDB**: A fully managed NoSQL database service that provides fast and predictable performance.
